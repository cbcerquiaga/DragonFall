# DragonFall
Implemented in Unreal Engine 4
Taking aspects from on other games like Star Wars Battlefront, Chivalry, and Lair, our goal is to make a rewarding, exciting experience for players to enjoy. At its core, our game is really 2 different games: a dragon flight simulator and a mechlike medieval fantasy action game. Both aspects of the game interact with one another, and involve both PvP and PvE play, hopefully leading to unique gameplay every time through.
